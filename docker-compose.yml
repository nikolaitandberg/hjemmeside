# Note: the image intentionally includes full node_modules (not just the
# Next.js standalone subset) so that `prisma migrate deploy` can run at
# container startup. The Prisma 6.x CLI has a deep transitive dependency
# tree that is not part of the standalone output, and cherry-picking
# individual packages breaks on every Prisma update. Image size (~400 MB
# extra) is an acceptable trade-off for a personal site.
